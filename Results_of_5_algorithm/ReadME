Results obtained after runing five different localization algorithms on the received BLE data from varying number of (1-4) fixed scanners 
in a room.

Fixed scanners are attached on walls and scan for data emitted from beacon worn by subject. On receving the data, Fixed scanner then 
sends the data to gatewy which inturn sends to localization algorithm.

Depending upon the type of algorithm, localization process could time or data driven. 
The localization algorithm versions 1-4 collect and process packets within given time period. The window size is varied from 3-18s for evaluation pupose.
The localization algorithm version 5 process the max number of packets (1-11) from any fixed scanners within the room
